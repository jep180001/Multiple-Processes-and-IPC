# Multiple-Processes-and-IPC

## Overview:
### The project will simulate a simple computer system that is made up of a CPU and Memory.
### The CPU and Memory will be simulated by separate processes that communicate to each other.
### Memory will contain one program that the CPU will execute and then the simulation will end.

### project.java - this will act as the processor
### Memory.java - this will act as the main memory

### To run, have both java files and the input file in the same directory. 
### Can just call the project file to run both along with the command-line arguments, 
### ex: java project sample1.txt 30.
